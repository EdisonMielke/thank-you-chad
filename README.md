# Thank You Chad!
A GitHub thank you card to our wonderfully helpful and super-cool TA: Chad Wood.

For Chad: Just clone the repo, type 'make' in the command line and go through the card!

For Students: Here is some info you should know:

- To add your changes, fork the repo to create your own branch, and then make your changes.

- Most of the information is already in the main.c file for how you should format your thank-you note for Chad.
       
- Once you've made all of your changes, create a pull request and I'll approve it!
